This is another TTRPG (Table Top Role-Playing Game) bot.

I have created this as my own take on the TTRPG/dice roller bot. It is mainly built to allow me to automate more complicated rolls/rules for the Paizo Pathfinder 1st edition game rules.

I am currently running the Kingmaker AP created by Paizo so some rules from the Game Mastery Kingdom Building rules will be included

Current functions:
  - Magic item Generator

Future functions:
  - Dice roller
  - Unchained skill, Profession gold generator
  - HP roller
  - Random Encounter generator (simple)
